                A credit union is a member-owned, not-for-profit financial cooperative. Unlike banks that are driven by profit, credit unions exist to serve their members. They provide a safe place to save and access affordable credit, often at more favourable rates than commercial banks. Members benefit from dividends and have a say in how the credit union is run.
